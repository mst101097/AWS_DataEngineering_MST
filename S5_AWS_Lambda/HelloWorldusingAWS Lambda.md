Let us start with Hello World using AWS Lambda. We will use Python3 as a runtime environment.

Go to AWS Console and use the Lambda template.

Deploy and Test and make sure it is successful.

Here are the default names that are used.

Program Name: lambda_function

Function Name: lambda_handler

We can change the names of the file, function etc. However, we need to ensure that Handler details as part of Runtime Settings are updated.

Let us rename the file name to main.py and validate. We will revert the name back to lambda_function.py.
