List the folders in the dg-retail bucket created earlier. It is recommended to list the objects recursively to review all the objects.

Delete the folders in the retail_db main folder from the bucket created earlier.

Go to AWS Web Console and confirm that folders and objects in the retail_db folder within the dg-retail bucket are deleted.

Copy all the folders along with files in the retail_db folder from the local file system to s3. Make sure to copy these folders along with the files in them.

Make sure to validate using both CLI as well as AWS Web Console.

Hint: You can delete as well as copy all the folders and files using one command in recursive mode.
